#Covid Data Project in C++

Overview:
The "Covid Data" project is a C++ application designed to search for the country with the highest number of Covid-19 cases using the vector data structure. By analyzing Covid-19 case data from various countries, the application identifies and displays the country with the most reported Covid-19 cases. This project aims to provide a computational approach to identifying significant Covid-19 trends and statistics.

Features:

1. Data Collection: The application compiles Covid-19 case data from multiple countries, storing the data in a vector data structure within the C++ program.

2. Data Analysis: Utilizing the vector data structure, the application performs a search to identify the country with the highest number of Covid-19 cases.

3. Result Display: The application displays the name of the country with the most Covid-19 cases, along with the corresponding case count, to the user.

4. User Interface: The project includes a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) where users can initiate the search and view the results.

Implementation:

* Data Collection: The project integrates with a reliable data source (e.g., an API or database) to fetch Covid-19 case statistics for multiple countries. The fetched data is then stored in a vector data structure.

* Data Analysis: Using the vector data structure, the application implements an algorithm to search for the country with the highest number of Covid-19 cases, iterating through the data and comparing case counts.

* User Input Handling: The application includes functionality to handle user input and initiate the search process, ensuring a seamless user experience.

* Display Output: The application utilizes C++ output mechanisms (e.g., console output) to present the country with the most Covid-19 cases and the corresponding case count to the user.

Conclusion:
The "Covid Data" project in C++ demonstrates the effective use of the vector data structure for analyzing and identifying significant Covid-19 statistics. By implementing a search algorithm within the C++ program, the application provides users with valuable insights into the country with the highest Covid-19 case count. The project highlights the versatility of C++ in handling data-intensive tasks and showcases its potential for data analysis and computation in various domains.
